1
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,000
Experiments in Art and Technology or E.A.T.

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,500
is an organization created by

3
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,000
two artists and two engineers 

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
with the aim of facilitating collaboration

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
between these two worlds. 

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Although many documents exist, 

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
it may be difficult for the researcher 

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,500
to accurately represent 

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,000
both the activities of the organization 

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and the particular roles of participants in the project.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That is why we designed 

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
what we call a datascape.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The EAT archives consist of diverse documents: 

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
exhibition catalogs, like these, 

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
publications, photographs, 

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
even this blue perforated card 

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
with information on engineers and their specialities 

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
which allowed artists and engineers

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
to be put in touch with each other.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The challenge here is to manage 

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
large amounts of data. 

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That is why, with the Sciences Po MÃ©dialab 

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
a methodology laboratory for digital research 

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
in the humanities 

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,500
we designed what we call a datascape. 

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The datascape is a piece of software 

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
that allows the researcher to explore the archives

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,500
via a series of interactive visualizations.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Factual information (who? what? when? where?)

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
must be extracted from the document. 

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The researcher then enters it 

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,500
into the database manually. 

33
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,000
The visualisation of this database 

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,500
is what we call the datascape, 

35
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,000
which will allow the researcher 

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
to test hypotheses 

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
or to see other unforeseen hypotheses emerge.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It is this exploration that allows the researcher

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,500
to answer certain questions, 

40
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,000
in this case, 

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,500
"What is E.A.T.?" or 

42
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,000
"What is a collaboration 

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,500
between an artist and an engineer?"

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
With the processed information, 

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,500
it is possible to determine a number of phases

46
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,000
from the conception and implementation 

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
of a work to its exhibition 

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
and any necessary restoration work.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:4,000 
'Oracle' co-created by 

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
artist Robert Rauschenberg 

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,500
and engineer Billy Kluver, 

52
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,000
and which is preserved now 

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
at the Centre Pompidou, is an interesting case.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Co-signed by the artist and the engineer

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
it raises a number of questions 

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
about the nature of the collaboration.

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
In the datascape, we find information 

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
about the conception and realization 

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
phases of the work. 

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We also have a number of visual documents 

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
that show different ways 

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
in which the work was presented, 

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,500
in the museum and in other places. 

64
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Finally, the datascape shows us 

65
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,500
that the work went through 

66
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
a certain number of restoration phases 

67
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,000
before its exhibition phase. 

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,500
This also provides information 

69
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,000
on the possible difficulties of preserving

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
a work that integrates different technologies.

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,500
It is difficult to show 

72
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,000
the ensemble of a particular actor's actions

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
his development and trajectory

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
within the organization.

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,500
For example, Robert Rauschenberg, 

76
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,000
co-founder of E.A.T. 

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
was very much involved during the period 

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
from the mid-1960s to 1970 

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,500
at which point he seems to have focussed

80
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,000
on other projects. 

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This, however, did not prevent him

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,500
from continuing to be involved 

83
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,000
with E.A.T.-led initiatives. 

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Similarly, it is not inconsistent to find 

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
that his most frequent collaborator 

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
was engineer Kluver, another co-founder of EAT.

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The extraction of information from the documents

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,500
is painstaking work which can lead to errors.

89
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,000
But the ability to visualise

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
the results of work done 

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
allows researchers to correct any errors. 

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It is also important to note 

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,500
that any information called up 

94
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,000
must be supported by a source which will verify

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
that such and such a person was involved in such and such an activity

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
All information is then aggregated 

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
to form overviews 

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
of activities and actors/participants.

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
For example, E.A.T. activity peaked

100
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
between the mid-1960s and early 1970s 

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
during which time it pursued 

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
a certain number of different activities. 

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
One advantage of the datascape here 

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,500
is that it allows us to focus 

105
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,000
not only on core activities 

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
but also to highlight 

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
all the 'smaller activities' that occupied E.A.T.

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The organization's activities given its New York base

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,500
were naturally concentrated in North America 

110
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,000
but there were also projects 

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
in other parts of the world - India and, notably, Japan.

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Another of the datascape's advantages 

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
is to allow a multiplicity of readings 

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
that depend on the specificity of the subject.

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Here for example, 

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,500
it is possible to see the activities, 

117
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,000
the types of activity most prevalent 

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
within the organization, 

119
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
to measure the importance attached 

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
to certain actors/participants, 

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
to observe the recurrence of certain patterns 

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
or to observe the organization's aesthetic tendencies

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and the technologies used most frequently

124
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
All the data can also be exported 

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and imported into statistical analysis software 

126
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,500
such as the network analysis programme, Gephi.

127
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Of course, the researcher's work does not end there.

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
In fact, it is only just beginning.

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
From the visualizations provided by the datascape,

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
the researcher must verify the hypotheses

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
and attempt to answer his or her questions

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
such those which we asked here: 

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What is E.A.T.? What is artist-engineer collaboration?

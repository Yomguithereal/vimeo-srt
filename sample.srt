<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>This is Michael Bluth.</i>

2
00:00:08,201 --> 00:00:10,192
<i>For 10 years, he's worked</i>
<i>for his father's company...</i>

3
00:00:10,303 --> 00:00:12,294
<i>waiting to be made a partner.</i>

4
00:00:12,405 --> 00:00:15,203
<i>And right now, he's happy.</i>

5
00:00:15,308 --> 00:00:18,038
- <i>This is Michael's mother.</i>
- Look what they've done, Michael.

6
00:00:18,144 --> 00:00:19,736
<i>She isn't happy.</i>

7
00:00:19,846 --> 00:00:22,440
Look what the homosexuals
have done to me.

8
00:00:22,548 --> 00:00:24,982
You can't just comb that out
and reset it?

9
00:00:25,084 --> 00:00:28,383
<i>Currently, she's upset that her</i>
<i>husband's retirement party...</i>

10

<i>is being upstaged by a group</i>
<i>of gay protesters.</i>

11
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,416
We're here! We're queer!
We want to get married on the ocean!

12
00:00:34,527 --> 00:00:37,928
Everything they do
is so dramatic and flamboyant.

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,796
It just makes me
want to set myself on fire.

14

{ Sighs]
Good grief, Mother.

15
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:47,131
Not all homosexuals
are flamboy...

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,265
Oh, my God! I have
the exact same blouse.

17

<i>This is Michael's twin sister, Lindsay.</i>

18
00:00:51,744 --> 00:00:53,644
I like it better on him.

19

<i>As a youthful act of defiance,</i>
<i>Lindsay married...</i>

20

<i>this man.</i>

21
00:00:58,451 --> 00:01:00,976

<i>fund-raisers.</i>

23
00:01:03,656 --> 00:01:05,851
Oh, no.
I'm completely stuffed.

24
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:08,426
<i>Michael and his sister</i>
<i>haven't spoken in a year.</i>

25

26

<i>Michael's oldest brother.</i>

27
00:01:13,232 --> 00:01:16,201
<i>[Michael]</i>
<i>So, this is the magic trick, huh?</i>

28
00:01:16,302 --> 00:01:20,136
Illusion, Michael. A trick is something
a whore does for money.

29
00:01:23,743 --> 00:01:25,677
Or candy.

30
00:01:25,778 --> 00:01:29,441
<i>[Narrator] Gob recently started</i>
<i>the Alliance of Magicians...</i>

<i>any performer...</i>

32

34
00:01:36,188 --> 00:01:39,419
- Hey, Buster.
- <i>the youngest of Michael's siblings.</i>

35
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:42,688
You know, you don't need
to do that, buddy. It's okay.

36
00:01:42,795 --> 00:01:45,355
<i>Thanks to the family's largesse,</i>
<i>Buster has studied everything...</i>

37
00:01:45,464 --> 00:01:48,160
<i>from Native American</i>
<i>tribal ceremonies...</i>

38
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:53,694
<i>to cartography, the mapping</i>
<i>of uncharted territories.</i>

39
00:01:53,806 --> 00:01:56,832
Hasn't everything already
sort of been discovered, though...

40
00:01:56,943 --> 00:01:59,776
by, like, Magellan and Cortés?

41
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,779
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- All those folks.

42
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:03,781
Those guys did a pretty good job...

43
00:02:03,883 --> 00:02:07,182
but there's still, you know...

44
00:02:07,286 --> 00:02:10,585
<i>[Narrator] He also suffers</i>
<i>from crippling panic attacks.</i>

45
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,215
<i>Yes, this is his family.</i>

46
00:02:13,326 --> 00:02:15,385
<i>So why is Michael so happy?</i>

47
00:02:15,494 --> 00:02:18,895
<i>Because he's decided to never</i>
<i>speak to these people again.</i>

48
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:28,873
<i>Michael was feeling more</i>
<i>generous about his family...</i>

49
00:02:28,975 --> 00:02:31,239
<i>on the morning of the boat party.</i>

50
00:02:31,344 --> 00:02:35,906
What comes before anything? What have we
always said is the most important thing?

51
00:02:36,015 --> 00:02:39,542
- Breakfast.
- Family.

52
00:02:39,652 --> 00:02:43,053
Family. Right. I thought
you meant of the things you eat.

53

<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>This is Michael's son, George Michael.</i>

54

I mean, we have made nothing
but sacrifices for this family...

55
00:02:48,894 --> 00:02:50,725
<i>and tonight</i>
<i>it all pays off, my boy.</i>

Tonight your granddad

<i>[Narrator] To prove his dedication</i>
<i>to the family business...</i>

<i>ofhis father's latest housing tract.</i>

60
00:03:01,574 --> 00:03:04,566
<i>The guys live in the attic</i>
<i>so that the house...</i>

61
00:03:04,677 --> 00:03:06,941
<i>can still function</i>
<i>as a pristine selling tool.</i>

62
00:03:07,046 --> 00:03:08,980
<i>And when I do get that promotion...</i>

63
00:03:09,081 --> 00:03:11,379
I'll finally be able
to get you what you deserve.

64
00:03:11,484 --> 00:03:13,645
Like a real home.

65
00:03:13,753 --> 00:03:16,051
This is a real home.

66
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:18,487
No, it's not.
It's a fake home, son.

67
00:03:18,591 --> 00:03:20,491
You want the loops
or the flakes today?

68
00:03:20,593 --> 00:03:22,823
<i>[Narrator] The guys then</i>
<i>headed down to Balboa Island...</i>

69
00:03:22,928 --> 00:03:25,328
<i>so George Michael could work</i>
<i>at the frozen banana stand...</i>

<i>his grandfather started in 1953.</i>

71

Bananas.

72
00:03:29,235 --> 00:03:32,568
<i>Michael, meanwhile,</i>
<i>was meeting his brother Gob...</i>

73
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,730
<i>hoping to discuss</i>
<i>his father's boat party.</i>

74
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,570
<i>Do you have your check</i>
<i>for your share of the party?</i>

75
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,144
You know, I sort of thought
my contribution...

76
00:03:40,246 --> 00:03:42,146
could be a magic show.

77
00:03:43,716 --> 00:03:46,014
- Oh, that's perfect, Gob.
- Thank you.

78
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:49,417
I just remembered something.
Dad's retiring, not turning six.

79
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:53,424
Hey, come on! I just bought this new
illusion called the Aztec Tomb.

80
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:56,654
- It cost like 18 grand! I'm gonna do it on the boat.
- I don't care.

81
00:03:56,762 --> 00:03:59,856
What do you care? Can't you just charge
the party to the company?

82
00:03:59,965 --> 00:04:03,059
- It's not a business expense.
- So what? Lindsay's been staying
at the Four Seasons for a month.

83
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:05,467
She's probably charging the company.

84
00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:08,096
Lindsay's been in town for a month?

85
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:11,142
I don't think so.

86
00:04:11,243 --> 00:04:13,711
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Michael was upset to hear this...</i>

87
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:16,077
<i>so he went to discuss it with his mother.</i>

88
00:04:16,182 --> 00:04:19,709
Mom! Mother! Give me your
company checkbook. You're cut off.

89
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:22,652
Michael, look.
Look what happened to my fox.

90
00:04:22,755 --> 00:04:25,383
Someone cut off his little foot.

91
00:04:25,491 --> 00:04:28,483
Is it... Is it noticeable?

92
00:04:28,594 --> 00:04:31,028
You've gotta remember...
you're gonna be all splattered in red paint.

93
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,030
That's gonna distract the eye.

94
00:04:33,132 --> 00:04:36,659
I don't want you charging any more
of your personal expenses to the company.

95
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:40,535
Well, I had to pay for the Aztec Tomb.
Gob says it's a career maker.

96
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,040
Wait a minute. The company
paid for the Aztec Tomb? That's great.

97
00:04:44,143 --> 00:04:46,270
Well, I was talking about Lindsay, okay?

98
00:04:46,378 --> 00:04:50,872
You put her in a five-star hotel, on top
of which you didn't tell me she was in town.

99
00:04:50,983 --> 00:04:54,885
<i>If you're saying I play favorites, you're</i>
<i>wrong. I love all my children equally.</i>

100
00:04:54,987 --> 00:04:57,421
I don't care for Gob.

101
00:04:59,525 --> 00:05:02,983
Good grief. I dipped into
the kitty a couple of times.

102
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,222
You should be focused on tonight.

103
00:05:05,331 --> 00:05:07,925
Dad's making a big announcement.

104
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:11,730
Yeah? I knew it.
It's about me, isn't it?

105
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:16,502
I wonder how I can talk you
out of ever making that face again.

- It's good. It's going to be good.
- Yeah? Great.

- I really have.
- Really?

- It's just been very busy.
- Ugh! It's been crazy.

123

We just had an amazing

- HOOP?
- My anti-circumcision movement.
